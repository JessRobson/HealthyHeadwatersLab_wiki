# Communications
As part of the Healthy Headwaters Lab, we communicate our work in a wide range of ways, including academic presentations, meetings with partners, public outreach, and social media. This file gives resources and guidelines for all of these different ways of communicating.

### Ground Rules
* Treat all communications using your UWindsor and Healthy Headwaters Lab accounts as professionally as possible.
* In-person, Asana, and email communication is preferred over texting. Save texting for immediate updates (e.g., in the field, traveling between sites, running late for a meeting). Teams chats can be useful to reach people or a group quickly, but shouldn't be used for important communications because chats are easily missed.
* In case of doubt, cc: Catherine and/or the healthy.headwaters@uwindsor.ca email address
* When working with the public or within a stakeholder group, feel free to give out either the healthy.headwaters@uwindsor.ca email address or Catherine’s office phone number. When doing so, let Catherine know so she has context for any inquiries that come in.
* Be mindful of inclusive language including gender-free pronouns and your language. An elevator pitch/grandparent approach to describing your science is good practice. Talking to farmers, community members, elders about your science requires practice and mindfulness about the levels and details of science being discussed. This will take practice and as a lab we will provide feedback.
* You are encouraged to use the lab logos and templates, and acknowledge the various funding sources and partnerships. Logos are saved on the shared drive under Communications/Branding-Logos,Templates,Design Assets/Logos-HHL for easy access. If you find or develop a new logo, please add to them as appropriate so that others can use the same logos.


### Academic presentations
Presentations, both oral and poster, can be difficult to do well! However, with enough practice and preparation, they are a very effective way to communicate your work with others, solicit feedback, and expand your network.
When preparing a presentation, keep these deadlines in mind:
* Circulate the abstract to all co-authors more than one week before deadline. Let your co-authors know what the deadline for submission is, and make sure you will have enough time to address any comments before that deadline.
* For posters, circulate the draft poster to all co-authors at least one week before the printing deadline. Ideally, circulate it earlier than that to allow yourself time to address comments. If any comments are contentious, you may need to recirculate a revised draft version for review. **Recirculate the final poster version at least two business days before printing.**
* If you are giving an oral presentation, you should plan to give a practice presentation to the lab group at least one week before the scheduled presentation. If you are new to presenting, or unsure about the presentation matter, you should give a practice presentation two weeks before the scheduled presentation. This gives you buffer time to incorporate comments on the practice presentation and give a second practice presentation if necessary.

#### Creating good oral presentations
You are encouraged to begin each public presentation with respect and gratitude through an acknowledgement of the indigenous peoples and places. Please acknowledge the lands where you conducted the work but also where you are presenting. Please work with Candy and Catherine if you are unsure or would like some feedback and practice.

### Public outreach
Public outreach is an important part of working in this lab, and a key mechanism of our lab’s translation of research. We need to connect with people to gain public support, community buy-in, and the valuable local knowledge that is vital for building useful and needed work.

As a member of the Healthy Headwaters Lab, there may be various opportunities for public outreach, both planned (e.g., community presentations, information booths at local events) and unplanned (e.g., you may be approached by neighbours while you are doing field work). You should practice explaining your work in a way that engages rather than alienates people. Avoid jargon and technical terms. Practice speaking concisely and relating your work to outcomes that matter to the audience. 

#### Social media and blogs
Social media is a type of public outreach, and can be an effective one at that. Shayenna oversees the Healthy Headwaters social media program, and content is tracked in the shared drive at General/Communications/Social Media. Within this folder there is a tracking file showing past and planned future social media and blog posts, as well as a template file. If you have been assigned a topic, use the template file to craft a blog post and concurrent social media posts. Note that a blog post isn't necessary/appropriate for all topics, but the same template should be filled out social media posts without blogs. Save the filled out template in a new folder with the anticipated date for posting along with any photos or media that should be included. Let Shayenna know when the post is ready to go.  

* On social media, use the hashtag #HealthyHeadwatersLab for tagging people, topics, or content related to the lab's activities. 
* Make sure content tagged aligns with the Healthy Headwaters Lab mission and follows all of the communications ground rules
* See the social media tracking file for more guidelines on social media posting, including hashtags

### Publications
Publications are one of our lab’s most important currency with the scientific community, and a key milestone for graduate students in the GLIER program (i.e., you need a publishable manuscript as a requirement of completion). You will work with Catherine to outline thesis chapters as publishable manuscripts, and these will be your guideposts throughout your program.  

In general, we promote and encourage publishing best practice. And it is a practice. Identify your targeted journals early and read the submission instructions carefully. We prefer to publish in journals that are open access or have open access as an option and thus Catherine has included publishing charges in various grants and budgets. When referencing – make sure to reference things like R packages, not just papers! Work with the university librarians to ensure you have cited things correctly, and they also have recommended ways to cite contributions from elders and other knowledge holders. For common types of citations (articles, reports, etc.) using Zotero (or another reference manager) makes life much easier!  

Additionally, you are highly encouraged to produce a creative work that accompanies each manuscript. Some journals require a single image/graphic as part of the abstract, some of our research has also been developed into a public library containing two-page downloadable resources for the public (see: http://tinyurl.com/carextips for an example). Some of our teaching has been captured in a YouTube video (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIFl_U7MGxA&t=2s).
