# Lab Work

A lot of general information about the GLIER facilities and protocols can be found in the [GLIER Student Handbook](http://www1.uwindsor.ca/glier/glier-graduate-student-handbook). For information about facilities, waste disposal, safety, etc. check there first.

### Safety
**ALWAYS make sure someone knows where you are and when you will be leaving if you are working after hours**    
Health and safety in the lab are paramount. Research is **never** worth risking injury. If you are ever in a situation where you feel unsafe, immediately discontinue the labwork. You can contact Catherine or the project manager to discuss options for making the work safe.  
  
  *All accidents, injuries and near misses (no injury) must be reported to a supervisor as soon as they occur.*  
  
For more information on accident reporting, see the University of Windsor [Health and Safety protocol](http://www1.uwindsor.ca/safety/report-an-accident)
  
Everyone involved in lab work should be adequately trained. It is ok to not know something - and if you forget, just ask! It is always better to double check with others if you're unsure about protocols, rather than risk your safety or compromise data. **Usable data require standardized lab procedures, so if you are even a little bit in doubt of how to process a sample, ASK**
