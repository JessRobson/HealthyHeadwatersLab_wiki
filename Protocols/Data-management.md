# Guidelines for Data Management

### Data Storage
* All raw and cleaned data should be stored on the Healthy Headwaters Lab OneDrive in the appropriate subfolder within the Data folder. 
* Data files that you are working on may be stored on your personal computer until they are cleaned up but **make sure** you back up all of your data regularly onto OneDrive. 
* Upload your data to OneDrive as soon as it is collected to avoid a backlog of uncategorized data!

#### Raw Data
Raw data should be saved within the Shared HHL OneDrive/Data/Raw data folder and the specific folder for the procedure/equipment used to collect it. For example, data collected from the Fluorometer would be stored in Shared HHL OneDrive/Data/Raw Data/OANL/Fluorometer.   
When working with the raw data, *copy it into a new file for your project*. This will allow raw data to be available to multiple team members. **Don't modify the raw data directly**  

#### Naming conventions
Data should be named using the following format: FILENAME_YYYMMDD. Generally the FILENAME will be concise and descriptive and refer to the project under which it falls (e.g., SedimentP_Essex_20190715).

#### Meta-data
Metadata for datasets should be stored in the GLI - Healthy Headwaters Lab - General/Data/Data metadata.xlsx file. Partner datasets and HHL-generated datasets are detailed in two different tabs.  
  
When creating field sites, please enter them into the GLI - Healthy Headwaters Lab - General/Operations/Lab Manual and Protocols/Field Protocols/Field_Site_metadata.xlsx file (**being developed**) to ensure all site names are unique.
