# Lab Structure
The Healthy Headwaters lab is made up of many different people in a variety of roles. Catherine is the lead PI and generally responsible for everything that happens in the lab. [Research staff](/Lab-structure/Lab-roles.md) perform a wide range of tasks, many of which are project-specific support. In general, Alyssa Frazao is the main contact for lab and field work and Jess Ives is the main contact for financial matters. Beyond staff, the lab also includes [students](/Student-projects.md), both graduate and undergraduate, and undergraduate volunteers.

While Catherine is the overall head of the lab, we take a co-leadership/co-directorship model that gives team members shared ownership of the lab responsibilities.
