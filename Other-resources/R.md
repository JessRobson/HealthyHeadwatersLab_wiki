# R and Data Analysis

#### Resources for Using R
Many resources exist for using R, and Google is your friend. We highly recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) as an interface for using R. RStudio makes it easier to see all of the pieces that you're working with in R at once.   
Here are a few good resources that we have found useful:  
* [**R for Beginners**](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) - This document provides a basic overview of R
* [**R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) - Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This is an open source book with lots of great information on working with your data in R. It includes information on bringing your data into R and then tidying, transforming, visualising, and modeling the data. *This is a great resource to read when starting your work in R*
* [**Efficient R Programming**](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html) - Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace. An electronically available book focused on tips and tricks to making your R coding more efficient, and is aimed at people who already have a basic understanding of R.
* [**What They Forgot to Teach You About R**](https://whattheyforgot.org/index.html) - Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester. This resource gives tips on good practices to cultivate when writing R scripts.
* [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) - Many of your questions can be answered by searching Stack Overflow
* [**Coding cheatsheets**](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - A whole host of cheatsheets for writing R code. Data Transformation and Data Visualization are particularly useful
* **For graphing**: 
  * [**ggplot cheatsheets**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
  * [**The R graph gallery**](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) - A gallery of many different plot types done created using ggplot, includes code and explanatory comments
  * [**TidyTuesday**](https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/) - A social data project through Twitter that allows people to play with silly data and produce some interesting graphics. This often won't be applicable to the Healthy Headwaters work, but could give good visualization ideas in general.
* There are also some R books in the Healthy Headwaters Lab (rm 313)
